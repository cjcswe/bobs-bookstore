            <summary>
            Gets and sets the LogGroup property. This is the name of the CloudWatch Logs group where

            <summary>
            Specifies the days to retain events in log groups which are created by this logger, if the one specified by <see cref="P:NLog.AWS.Logger.AWSTarget.LogGroup"/> doesn't already exist
            and <see cref="P:NLog.AWS.Logger.AWSTarget.DisableLogGroupCreation"/> is not <c>true</c>. Requires logs:PutRetentionPolicy permission to apply the retention policy to
            newly created log groups. The default value of <c>null</c> will not apply a retention policy to new log groups.
            <para>
            Note that log groups which already exist will not have this retention policy applied for startup performance reasons.
            </para>
            <para>
            Possible values could be found in the CloudWatchLogs API reference at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutRetentionPolicy.html#API_PutRetentionPolicy_RequestSyntax

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Note that invalid retention policy values will result in the policy not being applied, however this error is non-fatal and the application and will continue without the policy.

        <member name="P:NLog.AWS.Logger.AWSTarget.ProfilesLocation">
            <summary>
            Gets and sets the ProfilesLocation property. If this is not set the default profile store is used by the AWS SDK for .NET

            <summary>
            Gets and sets the Region property. This is the AWS Region that will be used for CloudWatch Logs. If this is not
            the AWS SDK for .NET will use its fall back logic to try and determine the region through environment variables and EC2 instance metadata.
            If the Region is not set and no region is found by the SDK's fall back logic then an exception will be thrown.

            <summary>
            Gets and sets the BatchPushInterval property. For performance the log messages are sent to AWS in batch sizes. BatchPushInterval

            <summary>
            Gets and sets the BatchSizeInBytes property. For performance the log messages are sent to AWS in batch sizes. BatchSizeInBytes 
            dictates the total size of the batch in bytes when batches are sent. If either BatchPushInterval or BatchSizeInBytes are exceeded the batch will be sent.
            <para>

            <summary>
            Gets and sets the LogStreamName property. When this is set the full name of the log stream will be equal to this value,
            as opposed to the computed value using <see cref="P:NLog.AWS.Logger.AWSTarget.LogStreamNamePrefix"/> and <see cref="P:NLog.AWS.Logger.AWSTarget.LogStreamNameSuffix"/>, which will be ignored.
            </summary>

            <para>
            The default is going to a Guid.

            <para>
            The default will use an empty string for this user-defined portion, meaning the log stream name will start with the system-defined portion of the prefix (yyyy/MM/dd ... )
